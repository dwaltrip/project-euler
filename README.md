##Project Euler

A collection of my solutions (using Python) to the [Project Euler programming challenges](https://projecteuler.net/problems). The challenges are quite fun. They require a good mix of mathematical insight, creativity, and algorithmic skill.

If you are coming to this page from a google search for project euler solutions, I highly recommend you work on the problem by yourself for a while. If you are stuck, search for terms related to the challenge to learn more about the problem and get ideas. It is much more satisfying to solve it yourself, so don't give up too easily! Good luck and have fun :)

Most of these scripts were written several years ago, and haven't been touched in a while, so I apologize if the code is a little messy. I have also included my failed attempts and partial solutions in this repository. I will get around to more clearly distinguishing actual solutions at some point, but for now you can see which problems I have fully solved by looking in the progress folder.
